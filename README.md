# MachineLearningProject

- Our initial goal for the project was to get access to our own personal Spotify data through the official Spotify API.
- Compare the different music taste of each group memeber and learn what made our music taste different.
- What were the similarities that each member had compared to one another.
- Emperically compare the dataset of each group member from one another to learn how and if our music taste was the same numerically.

# UPDATE!
- We were unable to get our own personal data from Spotify itself.
- It could take upwards of 30 days for it to be collected by Spotify and then delievered to us.

# CHANGE OF PLANS 
- So after discovering that it was gonna take too long to get our personal data from Spotify.
- We ended up using a dataset from Kaggle instead as that was readily avaliable.
