# MachineLearningProject

- Our initial goal for the project was to get access to our own personal Spotify data through the official Spotify API.
- Compare the different music taste of each group memeber and learn what made our music taste different.
- What were the similarities that each member had compared to one another.
- Emperically compare the dataset of each group member from one another to learn how and if our music taste was the same numerically.
